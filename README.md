# Spelling Words
Tools to help children memorize their school spelling lists.

The initial concept of this idea was written with my son on February 25, 2016 as a simple console application.  

The idea is to expand this program to a full-on Windows Universal app to be used accross devices.

To use the console app just build and run the executable by providing a text file of spelling words.

The application will read each word for and request you spell it. The application will track passes and fails 
and report results after all words in the list are done.
